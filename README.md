# Sagemaker-SS-Demo
Semantic segmentation demo using Amazon Sagemaker. 

A project that trains and deploys a Semantic Segmentation model using Amazon Sagemaker. The model is capable of performing semantic segmentation on the popular IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset into 3 unique pixel values (foreground, background, and border pixels). 

Steps taken to deploy the model:
- Create the notebook
- Prepare and visualize data
- Setting up Sagemaker role, S3 storage, and model training image
- Upload data to the S3 bucket
- Define model with hyperparameters
- Train model
- Perform inference
